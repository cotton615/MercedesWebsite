# The project is made to practice creating web-sites using Flask in Python.
## What website represents?
- The main page and details page: you can review all cars, inspect them and redirect yourself to the buying page.
- The about page: all the information about the "company" that holds all the cars.

## What problems had I confronted?
1. Migrations of the Database. By making a lot of changes to the database, it lead to incomprehension of all components and structure.
2. CSS and HTML. It was indeed hard to place all elements in a perfect, desired way.

## What can be added and improved?
1. The details page doesn't show images in a clear way.
2. The ability for the website to send email which will include all information about the deal.
